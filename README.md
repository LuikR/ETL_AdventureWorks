In this repo i detail my process for moving and transforming locally stored data into Azure SQL Database. For this I use Datafactory for ingestion and Databricks for transformation. The code used for Azure Datafactory can be found in 'Code',
the code used for transforming the data within Databricks can be found within 'DB Transform'. The Azure Resource Template can be used to orchestrate all the needed resources with one go and the process description goes into depth
about the used acctivities and accompanying code within Datafactory and Databricks.
